# kccbot
Drafted idea of a bot that makes the currency "fair" to every user.

The code written for this bot is very inefficient, as there aren't a lot of functions, etc.
The KCC bot was a copy of KCGame bot (V.3) and hasn't been updated ever since.
Don't actually use this bot, it's a template and a good place to start.

If you're just testing it out, please also include a json file named kccData1.json or make your own with that name and include a "{}"
Also replace the bot token with your bot token, the token in the code won't work.
